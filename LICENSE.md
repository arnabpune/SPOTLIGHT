# Definitions
“This License” refers to this document or a verbatim copy of it.<br/>
"Developer" refers to the entity or individual that holds the rights, ownership, or authority over the program and its associated intellectual property.
“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.<br/>
“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.<br/>
To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.
The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.<br/>
A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.<br/>
To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law,
except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br/>
To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br/>
An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that
(1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided),
that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.

# About

This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY

# Permissions

## Right to use unaltered
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output,
given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

## Propagation
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.
You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works,
provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.
Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies
of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

## Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the program as you receive it, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br/>
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.



# Restrictions

## Disclaimer of Warranty
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING
THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

## Limitation of Liability
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE,
BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

## Prohibition of Reverse-Engineering and Decompilation
The end user acknowledges and agrees that the program provided under this License, including its compiled version and any accompanying documentation, may contain valuable trade secrets and proprietary information of the developer.<br/>
The end user explicitly acknowledges and agrees that decompiling, reverse-engineering, disassembling, or attempting to derive the source code or underlying structure, ideas, or algorithms of the program is strictly prohibited, unless expressly permitted by applicable law.<br/>
Any unauthorized decompilation, reverse-engineering, or other attempts to obtain the source code or confidential information of the program are expressly prohibited and may result in civil and criminal penalties under applicable laws.<br/>
In the event that the end user requires information about interoperability or seeks to create an independent program compatible with the program provided under this License, the end user must first request such information from the developer.
The developer may, at its sole discretion, provide the requested information or impose additional terms and conditions on its provision.

# Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations.
If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work
the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest,
if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
